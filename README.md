# Diskuss

KC(Know Connections) is a dynamic web application that provides users with over 1000+ digital cards for easy discussions and idea sharing. The application is built using React.js and offers a sleek, responsive design to ensure seamless user experience across devices.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Levonglobal/digitalcard.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diskuss
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:

   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project, giving you full control over configuration files and dependencies.
